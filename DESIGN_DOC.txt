UPDATE:
	I think I'll do the multiplayer version if I have time over the break. For now the best I can do is finish the single player portion.

A statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project:
	Multiplayer game over the network,
	Depends on how hard to program the GUI 
	I'll make a 2-player tron motorcycle game or 
	MUD(multiplayer dungeon) based on tron.
	
A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface)
	Probably not going to using ncurses

	Save user stats in a file
	Setting up game server (networking)
