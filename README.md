# known bugs: 1. if you play it too long(> 1hr) you'll cause a seg-fault
#             2. if you die the character won't showing up in terminal 
#                again [due the getch() function i copied and pasted from
#                stack over flow] [what else can you expect me to do it
#                without using ncurses?]

# bad coding practices: (you can use this as an classic example for bad 
#                       coding practices, so it is actually a feature)
#                a. no separate functions/header files
#                b. stupid algorithm
#             
# add-ons i want to do but didn't have an incentive to do it:
#             1. multiplayer
#             2. single player ranking/highscores after u die
#             3. use good coding practices
